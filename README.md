# WeasleyClock
Senior capstone project for Jonathan Nelson, class of 2017

Setup and use:
server.js is the server file to be run by a Node.js application. It contains all of the code to run the server.
Dependencies are listed in server.js with an additional dependency being Servoblaster to run the servos.

Installation 
Node.js running on a Raspberry Pi (any model should work, though developed on a Pi Zero). 
Connect servos to the appropriate pins on the Pi (see Servoblaster documentation for details).
Servos connect via gears to the clock hands to move them.
